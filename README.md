# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
## This project is a business intelligence dashboard designed to track and analyze sales performance.
The data was cleaned and transformed using Excel / Python, and the dashboard was created in Tableau / Power BI.
It visualizes total revenue, sales trends over time, top-selling products, regional performance, and profit margins. Interactive filters allow stakeholders to analyze performance by product category, region, or sales rep.
Key Insights: Helped identify the best-performing products, sales peak seasons, and underperforming regions that need focus.
